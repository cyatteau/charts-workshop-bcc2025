# Crafting Web Visuals: Interactive Graphs & Charts

**Beer City Code 2025** | **8 Aug 2025, 9:00 am - 5:00 pm ET**

## Overview
Data holds hidden insights, and visualizations unlock their true potential. In this 6-hour workshop, you’ll learn to transform raw datasets into dynamic graphs, charts, and diagrams using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We’ll build custom visualizations with **Chart.js** and **D3.js** to make statistical data and mathematical patterns clear and compelling.

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- (Optional) Local HTTP server (e.g., `npx http-server`)

## Modules
1. **Module 1: Chart.js**  
   Live-code charts and explore configurations. Use the student guide to help you through the You Do and We Do sections.
2. **Module 2: D3.js**  
   Bind data to DOM, use scales, axes, draw simple shapes, transitions, layouts, and custom interactive visuals.
